# passwordkit
A quick, printable Password Emergency Kit to store in a safe or safety deposit box.
Useful if you get locked out or need someone else to access passwords while you're unavailable or otherwise incapacitated.
Heavily based upon [1password's Emergency Kit](https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/).

Note: This was made with Bitwarden in mind. Feel free to edit the original template to suit your needs.
If you don't have photoshop, [photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) works just as well.
