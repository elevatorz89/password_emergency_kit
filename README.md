# Password Emergency Kit
A quick, printable template to store in a safe or safety deposit box.
Useful if you get locked out or need someone else to access passwords while you're unavailable or otherwise incapacitated.
Heavily based upon [1password's Emergency Kit](https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/).

Note: This was made with Bitwarden in mind. Feel free to edit the original template to suit your needs.
If you don't have photoshop, [photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) works just as well.

**Avoid using an online PDF editor to fill in your credentials. Open the PDF in your web browser's PDF viewer, or use a word processor.**

If you plan on saving the PDF file with your credentials in it, make sure to encrypt the file using a seperate program. The built-in Adobe PDF encryption is insecure. I'd reconmend [Picocrypt](https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt) or [Hat.sh](https://hat.sh/).
